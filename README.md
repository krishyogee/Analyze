# Data Analysis Workflow with Python and GitHub Actions

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://github.com/krishyogee/Analyze/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

This project demonstrates a robust and automated data analysis workflow, leveraging Python for data processing and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. It focuses on ensuring code quality, reliable script execution, and automated publication of analysis results.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Error-Corrected Python Script**: The `execute.py` script has been meticulously reviewed and a non-trivial error impacting its data processing logic has been identified and rectified, ensuring accurate and reliable analysis.
*   **Python 3.11+ & Pandas 2.3+ Compatibility**: The project is configured to run specifically on Python 3.11 or newer and utilizes Pandas 2.3 or newer, leveraging the latest features and ensuring optimal performance.
*   **Data Conversion**: The `data.xlsx` file has been programmatically converted to `data.csv` for a consistent and easily parsable data source, which is committed to the repository.
*   **Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions**:
    *   **Code Quality**: Integrates [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for fast Python code linting, enforcing code quality standards and identifying potential issues early.
    *   **Script Execution**: Automatically runs `python execute.py` to perform the core data analysis.
    *   **Result Publishing**: The generated `result.json` output from the analysis is automatically published via GitHub Pages, providing a live demonstration of the analysis results.
*   **Dynamic Result Generation**: The `result.json` file is *not* committed to the repository; it is dynamically generated and published exclusively through the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that the repository only contains source code and configuration.
